Next Generation Infrastructure Core (NGIC) Release Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Introduction
-----------------
This is the beta release for NGIC VNF.
NGIC application can be run independently or as part of the test harness.

2.	User Guide
--------------
Refer to README.MD for further details on NGIC, HLD, features supported, test
plan. For build configurations and execution requisites please refer to
INSTALL.MD.

3. Feature for this release
----------------------------
This release supports following features as part of NGIC:
-	NGIC can run as a standalone application on bare-metal linux server or on a
	virtual machine using SRIOV and OVS dpdk.
-	Packet Filters for Service Data Flow (SDF)
-	ADC(Application Detection and control) rules
-	PCC(Policy Control and Charging) rules
-	UE sessions with multiple Bearer support
-	SDF and APN based Qos Metering for MBR
-	Gtpv2c messages supported by CP on S11 interface
-	Charging by volume and asynchronous notification.
-	Ipv4 support
-	Sponsored Domain Name support


4. OS and kernel version
------------------------
This is supported on Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 and kernel version less than 4.5

5. Known Bugs and limitations
-----------------------------
-       The current tested ADC rules are not fully conformant to 3GPP release 12 ADC AVPs.
-       ARP handling supported under KNI-Linux
-       ICMP supported under KNI-Linux
-       IPV4 fragmentation and option header not supported.
-       IPSec not supported.
-       Only ethernet v2 frame format is supported.
-       Logic issues found in prepare_acl_parameter() in dp/acl.c
-       ACL context's (struct rte_acl_ctx) trans_table parameter is not being checked
        for NULL by dpdk. trans_table may appear as NULL during handling of stray GTP
        packets by DP.
-       Updates to filter packets arriving at the S1U and SGI interfaces for
        processing by linux. ARP Packets OR
        packets w/ dest address = {[S1U_IP, SGI_IP]; MULTICAST ADDR; BROADCAST ADDR}
        are sent to Linux for processing. All other packets are sent to the UL or DL
        fast path cores for processing. These enhancements need to be tested for following,
                1- To be tested with targeted packets
                2- To be tested with S1U and SGI GW configuration
-       Addressed htonl byte order conversion issues, however the following items need to be addressed,
                1- Some inconsistencies continue to remain in these fields
                   @~/interface/interface.c::zmq_mbuf_process::CREATE_SESSION, MODIFY_SESSION,
                   DELETE_SESSION. These needs to be addressed over test scenarios/setups.
                2- Byte order changes to ~/cp/gtpv2c_messages/modify_bearer.c, delete_session.c need
                   to be thoroughly tested.
                3- This patch has NOT been tested for SGWC-SGWU, PGWC-PGWU, and dedicated bearer
                   configurations/test scenarios. Hence byte order changes to
                   ~/cp/gtpv2c_messages/create_bearer.c, create_s5s8_session.c,
                   delete_bearer.c, delete_s5s8_session.c have not been tested.
-		For running ngic-rtc without kni STATIC_ARP must be enabled in the Makefile.
		ether.c::construct_ether_hdr(...) needs linux (kni) support to ARP discover S1U, SGI peer MAC.

-		Without KNI option is only for preformance profiling. There is no support for:
		    - SGW-PGW separaton not suported in wokni option
		    - DP_DDN

6. Future Work
--------------
-	Limitations will be addressed
-	Performance optimization
-	IPV6 support
-	Neighbour Discovery and ICMPv6 stack support
